In this HackerRank Diagonal Difference problem solution Given a square matrix, calculate the absolute difference between the sums of its diagonals.

For example, the square matrix arr is shown below:

1 2 3

4 5 6

9 8 9  

The left-to-right diagonal = 1+5+9 = 15. The right to left diagonal = 3+5+9=17. Their absolute difference is |15-17| = 2.

Function description

Complete the diagonalDifference function in the editor below.

diagonalDifference takes the following parameter:

int arr[n][m]: an array of integers
Return

int: the absolute diagonal difference
Input Format

The first line contains a single integer, n, the number of rows and columns in the square matrix arr.

Each of the next n lines describes a row, arr[i], and consists of  space-separated integers arr[i][j].

Constraints

-100 <= arr[i][j] <= 100

Output Format

Return the absolute difference between the sums of the matrix's two diagonals as a single integer.


PROGRAM :

import java.util.Scanner;

public class Solution {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner in = new Scanner(System.in); 
        int n ;
        int diag1 = 0;
        int diag2 = 0;
        n = Integer.parseInt(in.nextLine());
        for(int i =0 ; i < n; i++){
            String str[] = in.nextLine().split(" ");
            diag1 = diag1 + Integer.parseInt(str[i]);
            diag2 = diag2 + Integer.parseInt(str[n-1-i]);
        }
        
        int diagDiff = Math.abs(diag1 -  diag2);        
        System.out.println(diagDiff);
    }    
}
