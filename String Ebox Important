Ben and Henry visited a Kids Carnival and were excited to see so many interesting arcades for kidsâ€™ entertainment.
                                                                                                                                                        
There was an Activity Zone wherein kids could participate in numerous thought provoking activities. Ben and Henry selected the Counting Puzzle Game that involved English alphabets, wherein they were given a string to play with.
                                                                                                                                                        
The objective of the Game is to find the number of unique substrings of length 'n' in the given string.
For example,
Consider the sample string s = "abca" and length n = 3
Substrings are {"a", "ab", "abc", "abca", "b", "bc", "bca", "c", "ca", "a"}
Substrings of length 3 are {"abc", "bca"} - both substrings are unique. So result is 2.

Write a program to help the kids win the game.
 
Input Format:
The first line of the input is the given string. Assume that the maximum length of the string as 50.
The second line of the input consists of an integer, n.
 
Output Format:
Output should display an integer that gives the number of unique substrings of length 'n' in the given string.
Refer sample input and output for formatting specifications.
 
Sample Input 1:
aaabbcaaa
3
Sample Output 1:
6
 
Sample Input 2:
aaaa
1
Sample Output 2:
1    

PROGRAM :

import java.util.*;
import java.util.HashSet;

public class Main
{
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		//ystem.out.println("Hello World");
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		String a=sc.nextLine();
		int b=sc.nextInt();
		HashSet <String> set = new HashSet <String>();
		
		for(int i=0;i<=a.length()-b;i++){
		    String substring =a.substring(i,i+b);
		    set.add(substring);
		}
		System.out.println(set.size());
	}
}
